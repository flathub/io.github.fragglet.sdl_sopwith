      Sopwith is a modern port of the classic 1980s shoot 'em up game of the
      same name. The game has a World War I aviation theme. The object of
      Sopwith is to destroy all enemy targets with a somewhat limited airforce.

        <p>there is still no editor for making custom levels, but a python library has been added for programmatically generating levels. an example level has been included, the first custom level!</p>
        <p>objects in custom levels can now be arbitrarily mirrored and rotated.</p>
        <p>The numeric keypad enter key can now be used to switch into fullscreen mode, and also when entering a hostname (thanks TechKnight).</p>
        <p>A long-standing bug was fixed where the computer planes would try to take off by flying straight up and then immediately stalling.</p>
        <p>The score is no longer reset between levels (this was a bug).</p>
        <p>At end of level, the remaining planes now "tick down" properly.</p>
        <p>A bug was fixed where the app icon was shown as a black silhouette.</p>
        <p>The manual page now documents the dashboard layout.</p>
        <p>The score will no longer be drawn over the medals for very large values.</p>

        <p>It is now possible to make and load custom levels (there is no proper level editor available yet though).</p>
        <p>There are now a number of alternative palettes that can be used that simulate different CGA palettes and old monitors (thanks techknight).</p>
        <p>There are now hotkeys to end or restart the current game (thanks techknight).</p>
        <p>There is now a -p command line option to specify TCP port number.</p>
        <p>Sound is now oversampled to reduce sound aliasing (thanks @kmill).</p>
        <p>Starting level is now synchronized between players at multiplayer start.</p>
        <p>A bug was fixed with the keybindings menu not working (thanks ranguli, NY00123)</p>
        <p>A missing include was added to fix build on Alpine Linux (thanks John Gebbie)</p>
        <p>An input bug was fixed where a backspace would leave some visual corruption, and the cursor now blinks.</p>
        <p>A bug was fixed where the same medal could be awarded twice.</p>
        <p>Timing of music on the title screen was fixed (thanks @NY00123).</p>

        <p>Sound on Windows was fixed.</p>
        <p>Medals are no longer cleared after a crash. Players now keep their medals until the end of the level, like their score.</p>
        <p>The purple heart medal is now only awarded to players injured in combat. Surviving a bird strike or crashing into an ox doesn't cut it.</p>
        <p>Out of tree builds were fixed (thanks Will Thompson)</p>
        <p>The close button now quits the game (thanks Will Thompson)</p>

        <p>Help text is now shown for new players. This is shown on game start in
novice mode, but won't be shown again after a successful flight. The help
text will also appear in other single player modes, but only if it looks
like you're really struggling to get the plane off the ground.</p>
        <p>It's no longer possible to flip the plane upside down while sitting
motionless on the runway (a bug since the original DOS versions).</p>
        <p>It's no longer possible to get wounded on the ground. If a plane shoots
another on the ground, that's a successful raid. This fixes a bug where
a wounded plane on the runway would still be damaged after takeoff.</p>
        <p>The game no longer freezes up in multiplayer mode if the other player
quits. When establishing a connection, a helpful message is shown about how
to abort.</p>
        <p>If the game quits with an error, a friendly dialog box now shows the error.</p>
